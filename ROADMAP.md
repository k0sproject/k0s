# k0s roadmap

k0s maintainers work in a KanBan-ish style, with a [public board] available defining the roadmap items. As always, a roadmap is a living entity and subject to change based on user feedback, maintainer interests, and other factors.

Reach out on [Slack] or [GitHub issues] if you have any questions or suggestions regarding the roadmap or k0s in general!
