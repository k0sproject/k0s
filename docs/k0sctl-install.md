# Install using k0sctl

k0sctl is a command-line tool for bootstrapping and managing k0s clusters. k0sctl connects to the provided hosts using SSH and gathers information on the hosts, with which it forms a cluster by configuring the hosts, deploying k0s, and then connecting the k0s nodes together.

With k0sctl, you can create multi-node clusters in a manner that is automatic and easily repeatable. This method is recommended for production cluster installation.

**Note**: The k0sctl install method is necessary for automatic upgrade.

## Prerequisites

You can execute k0sctl on any system that supports the Go language. Pre-compiled k0sctl binaries are availble on the [k0sctl releases page](https://github.com/k0sproject/k0sctl)).

**Note**: For target host prerequisites information, refer to the [k0s System Requirements](system-requirements.md).

## Install k0s

### 1. Install k0sctl tool

k0sctl is a single binary, the instructions for downloading and installing of which are available in the [k0sctl github repository](https://github.com/k0sproject/k0sctl#installation).

### 2. Configure the cluster

1. Run the following command to create a k0sctl configuration file:

    ```shell
    k0sctl init > k0sctl.yaml
    ```

    This action creates a `k0sctl.yaml` file in the current directory:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: k0sctl.k0sproject.io/v1beta1
    kind: ClusterConfig
    metadata:
      name: k0s-cluster
    spec:
      hosts:
      - role: controller
        ssh:
          address: 10.0.0.1 # replace with the controller's IP address
          user: root
          keyPath: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
      - role: worker
        ssh:
          address: 10.0.0.2 # replace with the worker's IP address
          user: root
          keyPath: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ```

2. Provide each host with a valid IP address that is reachable by k0ctl, and the connection details for an SSH connection.

 **Note**: Refer to the [k0sctl documentation](https://github.com/k0sproject/k0sctl#configuration-file-spec-fields) for k0sctl configuration specifications.

### 3. Deploy the cluster

Run `k0sctl apply` to perform the cluster deployment:

```shell
k0sctl apply --config k0sctl.yaml
```

### 4. Access the cluster

To access your k0s cluster, use k0sctl to generate a `kubeconfig` for the purpose.

```shell
k0sctl kubeconfig > kubeconfig
```

With the `kubeconfig`, you can access your cluster using either kubectl or [Lens](https://k8slens.dev/).

```shell
kubectl get pods --kubeconfig kubeconfig -A
```

```shell
NAMESPACE     NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

## Known limitations

* k0sctl does not perform any discovery of hosts, and thus it only operates on the hosts listed in the provided configuration.
* k0sctl can only add more nodes to the cluster. It cannot remove existing nodes.

## Next Steps

* [Control plane configuration options](configuration.md): Networking and datastore configuration
* [Worker node configuration options](worker-node-config.md): Node labels and kubelet arguments
* [Support for cloud providers](cloud-providers.md): Load balancer or storage configuration
* [Installing the Traefik Ingress Controller](examples/traefik-ingress.md): Ingress deployment information
