# Cluster extensions

k0s allows users to use extensions to extend cluster functionality.

At the moment the only supported type of extensions is helm based charts.

The default configuration has no extensions.

## Helm based extensions

### Configuration example

```yaml
helm:
  repositories:
  - name: stable
    url: https://charts.helm.sh/stable
  - name: prometheus-community
    url: https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
  charts:
  - name: prometheus-stack
    chartname: prometheus-community/prometheus
    version: "11.16.8"
    values: |
      storageSpec:
        emptyDir:
          medium: Memory
    namespace: default
```

By using the configuration above, the cluster would:

- add stable and prometheus-community chart repositories
- install the `prometheus-community/prometheus` chart of the specified version to the `default` namespace.

The chart installation is implemented by using CRD `helm.k0sproject.io/Chart`. For every given helm extension the cluster creates a Chart CRD instance. The cluster has a controller which monitors for the Chart CRDs, supporting the following operations:

- install
- upgrade
- delete

For security reasons, the cluster operates only on Chart CRDs instantiated in the `kube-system` namespace, however, the target namespace could be any.

#### CRD definition

```yaml
apiVersion: helm.k0sproject.io/v1beta1
kind: Chart
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2020-11-10T14:17:53Z"
  generation: 2
  labels:
    k0s.k0sproject.io/stack: helm
  name: k0s-addon-chart-test-addon
  namespace: kube-system
  resourceVersion: "627"
  selfLink: /apis/helm.k0sproject.io/v1beta1/namespaces/kube-system/charts/k0s-addon-chart-test-addon
  uid: ebe59ed4-1ff8-4d41-8e33-005b183651ed
spec:
  chartName: prometheus-community/prometheus
  namespace: default
  values: |
    storageSpec:
      emptyDir:
        medium: Memory
  version: 11.16.8
status:
  appVersion: 2.21.0
  namespace: default
  releaseName: prometheus-1605017878
  revision: 2
  updated: 2020-11-10 14:18:08.235656 +0000 UTC m=+41.871656901
  version: 11.16.8
```

The `Chart.spec` defines the chart information.

The `Chart.status` keeps the information about the last operation performed by the operator.
