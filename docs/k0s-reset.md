# Uninstall the k0s Cluster

Use the k0s CLI `reset` command to uninstall k0s, by removing all k0s-related files from the host.

`reset` operates under the assumption that k0s is installed as a service on the host. To prevent accidental triggering, the command will not run if the k0s service is running, so you must first stop the service:

1. Stop the service on controller nodes:

    ```shell
    sudo k0s stop
    ```

2. Invoke the `reset` command:

    ```shell
    $ k0s reset
