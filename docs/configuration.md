# k0s configuration

## Control plane

k0s Control plane can be configured via a YAML config file. By default `k0s server` command reads a file called `k0s.yaml` but can be told to read any yaml file via `--config` option.

An example config file with the most common options users should configure:

```yaml
apiVersion: k0s.k0sproject.io/v1beta1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: k0s
spec:
  api:
    address: 192.168.68.106
    sans:
    - my-k0s-control.my-domain.com
  network:
    podCIDR: 10.244.0.0/16
    serviceCIDR: 10.96.0.0/12
extensions:
  helm:
    repositories:
    - name: prometheus-community
      url: https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
    charts:
    - name: prometheus-stack
      chartname: prometheus-community/prometheus
      version: "11.16.8"
      namespace: default
```

### `spec.api`

- `address`: The local address to bind API on. Also used as one of the addresses pushed on the k0s create service certificate on the API. Defaults to first non-local address found on the node.
- `sans`: List of additional addresses to push to API servers serving certificate

### `spec.network`

- `podCIDR`: Pod network CIDR to be used in the cluster
- `serviceCIDR`: Network CIDR to be used for cluster VIP services.

### `extensions.helm`

List of [Helm](https://helm.sh) repositories and charts to deploy during cluster bootstrap. This example configures Prometheus from "stable" Helms chart repository.


## Configuring multi-node controlplane

When configuring an elastic/HA controlplane one must use same configuration options on each node for the cluster level options. Following options need to match on each node, otherwise the control plane components will end up in very unknown states:
- `network`
- `storage`: Needless to say, one cannot create a clustered controlplane with each node only storing data locally on SQLite.


## Full config reference

**Note:** Many of the options configure things deep down in the "stack" on various components. So please make sure you understand what is being configured and whether or not it works in your specific environment.

A full config file with defaults generated by the `k0s default-config` command:

### `spec.api`

- `externalAddress`: If k0s controllers are running behind a loadbalancer provide the loadbalancer address here. This will configure all cluster components to connect to this address and also configures this address to be used when joining new nodes into the cluster.
- `address`: The local address to bind API on. Also used as one of the addresses pushed on the k0s create service certificate on the API. Defaults to first non-local address found on the node.
- `sans`: List of additional addresses to push to API servers serving certificate
- `extraArgs`: Map of key-values (strings) for any extra arguments you wish to pass down to Kubernetes api-server process

### `spec.controllerManager`

- `extraArgs`: Map of key-values (strings) for any extra arguments you wish to pass down to Kubernetes controller manager process

### `spec.scheduler`

- `extraArgs`: Map of key-values (strings) for any extra arguments you wish to pass down to Kubernetes scheduler process

### `spec.storage`

- `type`: Type of the data store, either `etcd` or `kine`.
- `etcd.peerAddress`: Nodes address to be used for etcd cluster peering.
- `kine.dataSource`: [kine](https://github.com/rancher/kine/) datasource URL.

Using type `etcd` will make k0s to create and manage an elastic etcd cluster within the controller nodes.

### `spec.network`

- `provider`: Network provider, either `calico` or `custom`. In case of `custom` user can push any network provider.
- `podCIDR`: Pod network CIDR to be used in the cluster
- `serviceCIDR`: Network CIDR to be used for cluster VIP services.

#### `spec.network.calico`

- `mode`: `vxlan` (default) or `ipip`
- `vxlanPort`: The UDP port to use for VXLAN (default `4789`)
- `vxlanVNI`: The virtual network ID to use for VXLAN. (default: `4096`)
- `mtu`: MTU to use for overlay network (default `1450`)
- `wireguard`: enable wireguard based encryption (default `false`). Your host system must be wireguard ready. See https://docs.projectcalico.org/security/encrypt-cluster-pod-traffic for details.
- `flexVolumeDriverPath`: The host path to use for Calicos flex-volume-driver (default: `/usr/libexec/k0s/kubelet-plugins/volume/exec/nodeagent~uds`). This should only need to be changed if the default path is unwriteable. See https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/issues/2712 for details. This option should ideally be paired with a custom volumePluginDir in the profile used on your worker nodes.

### `spec.podSecurityPolicy`

Configures the default [psp](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/) to be set. k0s creates two PSPs out of box:

- `00-k0s-privileged` (default): no restrictions, always also used for Kubernetes/k0s level system pods
- `99-k0s-restricted`: no host namespaces or root users allowed, no bind mounts from host

As a user you can of course create any supplemental PSPs and bind them to users / access accounts as you need.

### `spec.workerProfiles`

Array of `spec.workerProfiles.workerProfile`
Each element has following properties:
- `name`: string, name, used as profile selector for the worker process
- `values`: mapping object

For each profile the control plane will create separate ConfigMap with kubelet-config yaml.
Based on the `--profile` argument given to the `k0s worker` the corresponding ConfigMap would be used to extract `kubelet-config.yaml` from.
`values` are recursively merged with default `kubelet-config.yaml`

There are a few fields that cannot be overridden: 
- `clusterDNS`
- `clusterDomain`
- `apiVersion`
- `kind`

Example:

```
  workerProfiles:
    - name: custom-role
      values:
         key: value
         mapping:
             innerKey: innerValue
```


Custom volumePluginDir:

```
  workerProfiles:
    - name: custom-role
      values:
         volumePluginDir: /var/libexec/k0s/kubelet-plugins/volume/exec
```

### `images`
Each node under the `images` key has the same structure
```
images:
    konnectivity:
      image: calico/kube-controllers
      version: v3.16.2
```
Following keys are available:

- `images.konnectivity`
- `images.metricsserver`
- `images.kubeproxy`
- `images.coredns`
- `images.calico.cni`
- `images.calico.flexvolume`
- `images.calico.node`
- `images.calico.kubecontrollers`
- `images.repository`

If `images.repository` is set and not empty, every image name will be prefixed with the value of `images.repository`

Example:
```
images:
  repository: "my.own.repo"
    konnectivity:
      image: calico/kube-controllers
      version: v3.16.2
```

In the runtime the image name will be calculated as `my.own.repo/calico/kube-controllers:v3.16.2`.

This only affects the location where images are getting pulled, omitting an image specification here will not disable the component from being deployed.


### Extensions

As stated in the [project scope](https://github.com/k0sproject/k0s#scope) we intent to keep the scope of k0s quite small and not build gazillions of extensions into the product itself.

To run k0s easily with your preferred extensions you have two options.

1. Dump all needed extension manifest under `/var/lib/k0s/manifests/my-extension`. Read more on this approach [here](manifests.md).
2. Define your extensions as [Helm charts](https://helm.sh/):

```
extensions:
  helm:
    repositories:
    - name: stable
      url: https://charts.helm.sh/stable
    - name: prometheus-community
      url: https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
    charts:
    - name: prometheus-stack
      chartname: prometheus-community/prometheus
      version: "11.16.8"
      values: |
        storageSpec:
          emptyDir:
            medium: Memory
      namespace: default
```

This way you get a declarative way to configure the cluster and k0s controller manages the setup of the defined extension Helm charts as part of the cluster bootstrap process.

Some examples what you could use as extension charts:
- Ingress controllers: [Nginx ingress](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/nginx-ingress), [Traefix ingress](https://github.com/traefik/traefik-helm-chart) ([tutorial](examples/traefik-ingress.md)), 
- Volume storage providers: [OpenEBS](https://openebs.github.io/charts/), [Rook](https://github.com/rook/rook/blob/master/Documentation/helm-operator.md), [Longhorn](https://longhorn.io/docs/0.8.1/deploy/install/install-with-helm/)
- Monitoring: [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/), [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts)


### Telemetry

To build better end user experience we collect and send telemetry data from clusters. It is enabled by default and can be disabled by settings corresponding option as `false`
The default interval is 10 minutes, any valid value for `time.Duration` string representation can be used as a value.
Example
```
telemetry:
  interval: 2m0s
  enabled: true
```
