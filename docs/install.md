# Quick Start Guide

 On completion of the Quick Start you will have a full Kubernetes cluster with a single node that includes both the controller and the worker. Such a setup is ideal for environments that do not require high-availability and multiple nodes.

## Prerequisites

**Note**: Before proceeding, make sure to review the [System Requirements](system-requirements.md).

Though the Quick Start material is written for Debian/Ubuntu, you can use it for any Linux distro that is running either a Systemd or OpenRC init system.

## Install k0s

1. Download k0s

    Run the k0s download script to download the latest stable version of k0s and make it executable from /usr/bin/k0s.

    ```shell
    curl -sSLf https://get.k0s.sh | sudo sh
    ```

2. Install k0s as a service

    The `k0s install` sub-command installs k0s as a system service on the local host that is running one of the supported init systems: Systemd or OpenRC. You can execute the install for workers, controllers or single node (controller+worker) instances.

    Run the following command to install a single node k0s that includes the controller and worker functions with the default configuration:

    ```shell
    sudo k0s install controller --single
    ```

    The `k0s install controller` sub-command accepts the same flags and parameters as the `k0s controller`. Refer to [manual install](k0s-multi-node.md#installation-steps) for a custom config file example.

    Is's possible to set environment variables with the install command:

    ```shell
    sudo k0s install controller -e ETCD_UNSUPPORTED_ARCH=arm
    ```

    The system service can be reinstalled with the `--force` flag:

    ```shell
    sudo k0s install controller --single --force
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    ```

3. Start k0s as a service

    To start the k0s service, run:

    ```shell
    sudo k0s start
    ```

    The k0s service will start automatically after the node restart.

    A minute or two typically passes before the node is ready to deploy applications.

4. Check service, logs and k0s status

    To get general information about your k0s instance's status, run:

    ```shell
    $ sudo k0s status
    Version: v1.23.6+k0s.2
    Process ID: 436
    Role: controller
    Workloads: true
    Init System: linux-systemd
    ```

5. Access your cluster using kubectl

    **Note**: k0s includes the Kubernetes command-line tool *kubectl*.

    Use kubectl to deploy your application or to check your node status:

    ```shell
    $ sudo k0s kubectl get nodes
    NAME   STATUS   ROLES    AGE    VERSION
    k0s    Ready    <none>   4m6s   v1.23.6+k0s
    ```

## Uninstall k0s

The removal of k0s is a two-step process.

1. Stop the service.

    ```shell
    sudo k0s stop
    ```

2. Execute the `k0s reset` command.

     The `k0s reset` command cleans up the installed system service, data directories, containers, mounts and network namespaces.

    ```shell
    sudo k0s reset
    ```

3. Reboot the system.

    A few small k0s fragments persist even after the reset (for example, iptables). As such, you should initiate a reboot after the running of the `k0s reset` command.
