# Uninstall/Reset

k0s can be uninstalled locally with `k0s reset` command and remotely with `k0sctl reset` command. They remove all k0s-related files from the host.

`reset` operates under the assumption that k0s is installed as a service on the host.

## Uninstall a k0s node locally

To prevent accidental triggering, `k0s reset` will not run if the k0s service is running, so you must first stop the service:

1. Stop the service:

    ```shell
    sudo k0s stop
    ```

2. Invoke the `reset` command:

    ```shell
    $ sudo k0s reset
    INFO[2021-06-29 13:08:39] * containers steps
    INFO[2021-06-29 13:08:44] successfully removed k0s containers!
    INFO[2021-06-29 13:08:44] no config file given, using defaults

    INFO[2021-06-29 13:08:44] no config file given, using defaults
    INFO[2021-06-29 13:08:44] * uninstall service step
    INFO[2021-06-29 13:08:44] Uninstalling the k0s service

    INFO[2021-06-29 13:08:45] * CNI leftovers cleanup step
    INFO k0s cleanup operations done. To ensure a full reset, a node reboot is recommended.
    ```

## Uninstall a k0s cluster using k0sctl

k0sctl can be used to connect each node and remove all k0s-related files and processes from the hosts.

1. Invoke `k0sctl reset` command:

    ```shell
    $ k0sctl reset --config k0sctl.yaml
    k0sctl v0.9.0 Copyright 2021, k0sctl authors.
