# Helm Charts

Defining your extensions as Helm charts is one of two methods you can use to run k0s with your preferred extensions (the other being through the use of [Manifest Deployer](manifests.md).

k0s supports two methods for deploying applications using Helm charts:

- Use Helm command in runtime to install applications. Refer to the [Helm Quickstart Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/) for more information.
- Insert Helm charts directly into the k0s configuration file, ``k0s.yaml``. This method does not require a separate install of `helm` tool and the charts automatically deploy at the k0s bootstrap phase.

## Helm charts in k0s configuration

Adding Helm charts into the k0s configuration file gives you a declarative way in which to configure the cluster. k0s controller manages the setup of Helm charts that are defined as extensions in the k0s configuration file.

## Example

In the example, Prometheus is configured from "stable" Helms chart repository. Add the following to `k0s.yaml` and restart k0s, after which Prometheus should start automatically with k0s.

```yaml
spec:
  extensions:
    helm:
      repositories:
      - name: stable
        url: https://charts.helm.sh/stable
      - name: prometheus-community
        url: https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
      charts:
      - name: prometheus-stack
        chartname: prometheus-community/prometheus
        version: "11.16.8"
        values: |
          storageSpec:
            emptyDir:
              medium: Memory
        namespace: default
```

Example extensions that you can use with Helm charts include:

- Ingress controllers: [Nginx ingress](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/nginx-ingress), [Traefix ingress](https://github.com/traefik/traefik-helm-chart) (refer to the k0s documentation for [Installing the Traefik Ingress Controller](examples/traefik-ingress.md))
- Volume storage providers: [OpenEBS](https://openebs.github.io/charts/), [Rook](https://github.com/rook/rook/blob/master/Documentation/helm-operator.md), [Longhorn](https://longhorn.io/docs/0.8.1/deploy/install/install-with-helm/)
- Monitoring: [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/), [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts)
