# Troubleshooting

There are few common cases we've seen where MKE fails to run properly. 

## CoreDNS in crashloop

The most common case we've encountered so far has been CoreDNS getting into crashloop on the node(s).

With kubectl you see something like this:
```sh
$ kubectl get pod --all-namespaces
NAMESPACE     NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kube-system   calico-kube-controllers-5f6546844f-25px6   1/1     Running   0          167m
kube-system   calico-node-fwjx5                          1/1     Running   0          164m
kube-system   calico-node-t4tx5                          1/1     Running   0          164m
kube-system   calico-node-whwsg                          1/1     Running   0          164m
kube-system   coredns-5c98d7d4d8-tfs4q                   1/1     Error     17         167m
kube-system   konnectivity-agent-9jkfd                   1/1     Running   0          164m
kube-system   konnectivity-agent-bvhdb                   1/1     Running   0          164m
kube-system   konnectivity-agent-r6mzj                   1/1     Running   0          164m
kube-system   kube-proxy-kr2r9                           1/1     Running   0          164m
kube-system   kube-proxy-tbljr                           1/1     Running   0          164m
kube-system   kube-proxy-xbw7p                           1/1     Running   0          164m
kube-system   metrics-server-7d4bcb75dd-pqkrs            1/1     Running   0          167m
```

When you check the logs, it'll show something like this:
```
$ kubectl -n kube-system logs coredns-5c98d7d4d8-tfs4q
plugin/loop: Loop (127.0.0.1:55953 -> :1053) detected for zone ".", see https://coredns.io/plugins/loop#troubleshooting. Query: "HINFO 4547991504243258144.3688648895315093531."
```

This is most often cause by systemd-resolved stub (or something similar) running locally and CoreDNS detects a possible loop with DNS queries.

The easiest but most crude way to workaround is to disable the systemd-resolved stub and revert the hosts `/etc/resolv.conf` to original

## `mke server` fails on ARM boxes

In the logs you probably see ETCD not starting up properly.

Etcd is [not fully supported](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/supported-platform.md#current-support) on ARM architecture, thus you need to run `mke server` and thus also etcd process with env `ETCD_UNSUPPORTED_ARCH=arm64`.

As Etcd is not fully supported on ARM architecture it also means that mke controlplane with etcd itself is not fully supported on ARM either.
