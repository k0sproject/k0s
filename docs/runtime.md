# Runtime

k0s supports any container runtime that implements the [CRI] specification.

k0s comes bundled with [containerd] as the default Container Runtime Interface (CRI) and [runc] as the default low-level runtime. In most cases they don't require any configuration changes. However, if custom configuration is needed, this page provides some examples.

## containerd configuration

By default k0s manages the full containerd configuration. You have the option of fully overriding, and thus also managing, the configuration yourself.

### User managed containerd configuration

In the default k0s generated configuration there's a "magic" comment telling containerd it is managed by k0s:

```toml
# k0s_managed=true
```

If you wish to take over the configuration management, remove this line.

To make changes to the containerd configuration you must first generate a default containerd configuration, with the default values set to `/etc/k0s/containerd.toml`:

```shell
containerd config default > /etc/k0s/containerd.toml
```

`k0s` runs containerd with the following default values:

```shell
/var/lib/k0s/bin/containerd \
    --root=/var/lib/k0s/containerd \
    --state=/run/k0s/containerd \
    --address=/run/k0s/containerd.sock \
    --config=/etc/k0s/containerd.toml
```

Next, add the following default values to the configuration file:

```toml
version = 2
root = "/var/lib/k0s/containerd"
state = "/run/k0s/containerd"
...

[grpc]
  address = "/run/k0s/containerd.sock"
```

## Automatic cgroup driver detection and upgrade safety

k0s automatically detects the appropriate cgroup driver (systemd or cgroupfs) for your environment. On new installations, k0s will select the best driver based on the host's init system (systemd or otherwise). On upgrades, k0s will preserve the previously used cgroup driver for compatibility and stability.

This detection logic ensures that both kubelet and containerd are always configured to use the same cgroup driver, preventing mismatches and related issues. The detection is performed at startup and is upgrade-safe: if a previous kubelet configuration is found, its cgroup driver setting is respected; otherwise, detection is based on the current environment.

You can still override the cgroup driver by specifying `cgroupDriver` in a the containerd configuration. Make sure you configure both containerd and kubelet to use the same driver.

## k0s managed dynamic runtime configuration

As of 1.27.1, k0s allows dynamic configuration of containerd CRI runtimes. This
works by k0s creating a special directory in `/etc/k0s/containerd.d/`, where
users can place partial containerd configuration TOML files (i.e. files with a
`.toml` extension).

K0s will automatically pick up these files and add them as containerd
configuration `imports`. If a partial configuration file contains a CRI plugin
configuration section, k0s will instead treat such a file as a [merge patch] to
k0s's default containerd configuration. This is to mitigate [containerd's
decision] to replace rather than merge individual plugin configuration sections
from imported configuration files. However, this behavior [may][containerd#7347]
[change][containerd#9982] in future releases of containerd.

Please note, that in order for drop-ins in `/etc/k0s/containerd.d` to take effect on running configuration, `/etc/k0s/containerd.toml` needs to be k0s managed.

If you change the first magic line (`# k0s_managed=true`) in the `/etc/k0s/containerd.toml` (by accident or on purpose), it automatically becomes "not k0s managed". To make it "k0s managed" again, remove `/etc/k0s/containerd.toml` and restart k0s service on the node, it'll be recreated by k0s.

To confirm that drop-ins are being applied to the running configuration, you can
check the contents of `/run/k0s/containerd-cri.toml`; drop-in specific
configuration should be present in this file.

### Examples

The following sections provide some examples of how to use k0s managed drop-in
configurations for common configuration tasks.

#### Configuring OCI registry mirrors

Say you host an internal registry mirror of Docker Hub as
`docker-mirror.internal.acme.corp`. Then you could use the following drop-in
configuration:

`/etc/k0s/containerd.d/cri-registry.toml`:

```toml
version = 2

[plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".registry]
config_path = "/etc/k0s/containerd.d/certs.d"
```

Create the file `/etc/k0s/containerd.d/certs.d/docker.io/hosts.toml` with the following content:

```toml
# Always resolve tags against Docker Hub as the "server"
server = "https://registry-1.docker.io"

[host."https://docker-mirror.internal.acme.corp:5000"]
capabilities = ["pull", "resolve"]
# Trust the internal mirror's certificate. Paths will be resolved relative to
# the containing file's directory, e.g. the below path will be resolved to
# /etc/k0s/containerd.d/certs.d/docker.io/internal-mirror.crt
ca = "internal-mirror.crt"
# Or, alternatively, disable TLS verification, if you know what you're doing:
# skip_verify = true

# Use Google's public pull-through cache
[host."https://mirror.gcr.io"]
capabilities = ["pull", "resolve"]
```

For more details on how to configure registry hosts, please refer to the
[official containerd configuration][containerd-hosts].

[containerd-hosts]: https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/release/1.7/docs/hosts.md

#### Using gVisor

[gVisor](https://gvisor.dev/docs/) is an application kernel, written in Go, that implements a substantial portion of the Linux system call interface. It provides an additional layer of isolation between running applications and the host operating system.

1. Install the needed gVisor binaries into the host.

    ```shell
    (
      set -e
      ARCH=$(uname -m)
      URL=https://storage.googleapis.com/gvisor/releases/release/latest/${ARCH}
      wget ${URL}/runsc ${URL}/runsc.sha512 \
        ${URL}/containerd-shim-runsc-v1 ${URL}/containerd-shim-runsc-v1.sha512
      sha512sum -c runsc.sha512 \
        -c containerd-shim-runsc-v1.sha512
      rm -f *.sha512
      chmod a+rx runsc containerd-shim-runsc-v1
      sudo mv runsc containerd-shim-runsc-v1 /usr/local/bin
    )
    ```

    Refer to the [gVisor install docs](https://gvisor.dev/docs/user_guide/install/) for more information.

2. Prepare the config for `k0s` managed containerd, to utilize gVisor as additional runtime:

    ```shell
    cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/k0s/containerd.d/gvisor.toml
    version = 2

    [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".containerd.runtimes.runsc]
      runtime_type = "io.containerd.runsc.v1"
    EOF
    ```

3. Start and join the worker into the cluster, as normal:

    ```shell
    k0s worker $token
    ```

4. Register containerd to the Kubernetes side to make gVisor runtime usable for workloads (by default, containerd uses normal runc as the runtime):

    ```shell
    cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
    apiVersion: node.k8s.io/v1
    kind: RuntimeClass
    metadata:
      name: gvisor
    handler: runsc
    EOF
    ```

    At this point, you can use gVisor runtime for your workloads:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx-gvisor
    spec:
      runtimeClassName: gvisor
      containers:
    k0s supports any container runtime that implements the [CRI] specification.

    ## Automatic cgroup driver detection and upgrade safety

      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
    ```

5. (Optional) Verify that the created nginx pod is running under gVisor runtime:

    ```shell
    # kubectl exec nginx-gvisor -- dmesg | grep -i gvisor
    [    0.000000] Starting gVisor...
    ```

#### Using nvidia-container-runtime

First, deploy the NVIDIA GPU operator Helm chart with the following commands on top of your k0s cluster:

```shell
helm repo add nvidia https://helm.ngc.nvidia.com/nvidia
helm repo update
helm install nvidia-gpu-operator -n nvidia-gpu-operator \
  --create-namespace \
  --set operator.defaultRuntime=containerd \
  --set toolkit.env[0].name=CONTAINERD_CONFIG \
  --set toolkit.env[0].value=/etc/k0s/containerd.d/nvidia.toml \
  --set toolkit.env[1].name=CONTAINERD_SOCKET \
  --set toolkit.env[1].value=/run/k0s/containerd.sock \
  --set toolkit.env[2].name=CONTAINERD_RUNTIME_CLASS \
  --set toolkit.env[2].value=nvidia \
  nvidia/gpu-operator
```

With this Helm chart values, NVIDIA GPU operator will deploy both driver and toolkit to the GPU nodes and additionally will configure containerd with NVIDIA specific runtime.

**Note**: Detailed installation instructions can be found in the [official
NVIDIA GPU Operator documentation][install-nvidia-gpu-operator].

[install-nvidia-gpu-operator]: https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/getting-started.html

## Using custom CRI runtimes

**Warning**: You can use your own CRI runtime with k0s (for example, `docker`). However, k0s will not start or manage the runtime, and configuration is solely your responsibility.

Use the option `--cri-socket` to run a k0s worker with a custom CRI runtime. The option takes input in the form of `<type>:<url>` (the only supported type is `remote`).

### Using Docker as the container runtime

As of Kubernetes 1.24, the use of Docker as a container runtime is [no longer
supported][dockershim deprecation] out of the box. However, Mirantis provides
[cri-dockerd], a shim that allows Docker to be controlled via CRI. It's [based
on the dockershim][future of dockershim] that was previously part of upstream
Kubernetes.

#### Configuration

In order to use Docker as the container runtime for k0s, the following steps
need to be taken:

1. Manually install required components.
  On each `k0s worker` and `k0s controller --enable-worker` node, both
  Docker Engine and cri-dockerd need to be installed manually. Follow the
  official [Docker Engine installation guide][install docker] and [cri-dockerd
  installation instructions][install cri-dockerd].

2. Configure and restart affected k0s nodes.
  Once installations are complete, the nodes needs to be restarted with the
  `--cri-socket` flag pointing to cri-dockerd's socket, which is typically
  located at `/var/run/cri-dockerd.sock`. For instance, the commands to start a
  node would be as follows:

      k0s worker --cri-socket=remote:unix:///var/run/cri-dockerd.sock

  or, respectively

  ```console
  k0s controller --enable-worker --cri-socket=remote:unix:///var/run/cri-dockerd.sock
  ```

  When running k0s [as a service](cli/k0s_install.md), consider reinstalling the
  service with the appropriate flags:

  ```console
  sudo k0s install --force worker --cri-socket=remote:unix:///var/run/cri-dockerd.sock
  ```

  or, respectively

  ```console
  sudo k0s install --force controller --enable-worker --cri-socket=remote:unix:///var/run/cri-dockerd.sock
  ```

In scenarios where Docker is managed via systemd, it is crucial that the
`cgroupDriver: systemd` setting is included in the Kubelet configuration. It can
be added to the `workerProfiles` section of the k0s configuration. An example of
how the k0s configuration might look:

```yaml
apiVersion: k0s.k0sproject.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterConfig
metadata:
  name: k0s
spec:
  workerProfiles:
    - name: systemd-docker-cri
      values:
        cgroupDriver: systemd
```

Note that this is a cluster-wide configuration setting that must be added to
the k0s controller's configuration rather than directly to the workers, or to
the cluster configuration if using [dynamic configuration]. See the [worker
profiles] section of the documentation for more details. When starting workers,
both the `--profile=systemd-docker-cri` and `--cri-socket` flags are required.
The profile name, such as `systemd-docker-cri`, is flexible. Alternatively,
this setting can be applied to the `default` profile, which will apply to all
nodes started without a specific profile. In this case, the `--profile` flag is
not needed.

Please note that there are currently some [pitfalls around container
metrics][cadvisor-metrics] when using cri-dockerd.

#### Verification

The successful configuration can be verified by executing the following command:

{% set kubelet_ver = k8s_version + '+k0s' -%}
{% set kubelet_ver_len = kubelet_ver | length -%}

```console
$ kubectl get nodes -o wide
NAME              STATUS   ROLES    AGE   {{{ 'VERSION'   | ljust(kubelet_ver_len) }}}   INTERNAL-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   OS-IMAGE             KERNEL-VERSION      CONTAINER-RUNTIME
docker-worker-0   Ready    <none>   15m   {{{ kubelet_ver | ljust(kubelet_ver_len) }}}   172.27.77.155   <none>        Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS   5.15.0-82-generic   docker://24.0.7
```

On the worker nodes, the Kubernetes containers should be listed as regular
Docker containers:

```console
$ docker ps --format "table {{.ID}}\t{{.Names}}\t{{.State}}\t{{.Status}}"
CONTAINER ID   NAMES                                                                                                   STATE     STATUS
