# External runtime dependencies

k0s is packaged as a single binary, which includes all the needed components.
All the binaries are statically linked which means that in typical use cases
there's an absolute minimum of external runtime dependencies.

However, depending on the node role and cluster configuration, some of the
underlying components _may_ have specific dependencies, like OS level tools,
packages and libraries. This page aims to provide a comprehensive overview.

The following command checks for known requirements on a host (currently only
available on Linux):

```shell
k0s sysinfo
```

## A unique machine ID for multi-node setups

Whenever k0s is run in a multi-node setup (i.e. the `--single` command line flag
isn't used), k0s requires a [machine ID]: a unique host identifier that is
somewhat stable across reboots. For Linux, this ID is read from the files
`/var/lib/dbus/machine-id` or `/etc/machine-id`. For Windows, it's taken from
the registry key `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\MachineGuid`.
If neither of the OS specific sources yield a result, k0s will fallback to use a
machine ID based on the hostname.

When running k0s on top of virtualized or containerized environments, you need
to [ensure][ensure-unique-id] that hosts get their own unique IDs, even if they
have been created from the same image.

## Linux specific
<!--
This piece of documentation is best-effort and considered to be augmented and
extended in the future. The kernel and cgroup requirements are basically taken
from kubernetes/system-validators. Often there's no real hint as to why they are
required (although most requirements seem pretty obvious). Also need to check
for requirements of kube-router and calico.
-->

### Linux kernel configuration

Needless to say, as k0s operates Kubernetes worker nodes, there's a certain
number of needed Linux kernel modules and configurations that we need in the
system. This basically stems from the need to run both containers and also be
able to set up networking for the containers.

The needed kernel configuration items are listed below. All of them are
available in Kernel versions 4.3 and above. If running on older kernels, check
if the distro in use has backported some features; nevertheless, it might meet
the requirements. k0s will check the Linux kernel release as part of its
pre-flight checks and issue a warning if it's below 3.10.

The list covers ONLY the k0s/kubernetes componentsâ€™ needs on worker nodes. Your
own workloads may require more.

<!-- Kernel config nesting is taken from the v4.3 kernel's menuconfig structure. -->

**Note:** As part of its pre-flight checks, k0s will try to inspect and validate
the kernel configuration. In order for that to succeed, the configuration needs
to be accessible at runtime. There are some typical places that k0s will check.
A bullet-proof way to ensure the accessibility is to enable
[`CONFIG_IKCONFIG_PROC`](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.3/init/Kconfig#L807),
and, if enabled as a module, to load the `configs` module: `modprobe configs`.

### Control Groups (cgroups)

Both [cgroup v1] and [cgroup v2] are supported.

Required [cgroup] controllers:

- cpu
- cpuacct
- cpuset
- memory
- devices
- freezer
- pids

Optional cgroup controllers:

- hugetlb ([kubernetes/kubeadm#2335 (comment)](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubeadm/issues/2335#issuecomment-722405527))
- blkio ([kubernetes/kubernetes#92287 (comment)](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/92287#issuecomment-1010723587))  
   containerd and cri-o will use blkio to track disk I/O and throttling in both
   cgroup v1 and v2.

[cgroup]: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html
[cgroup v1]: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.16/admin-guide/cgroup-v1/
[cgroup v2]: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.16/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html

### containerd and AppArmor

In order to use containerd in conjunction with [AppArmor], it must be enabled in
the kernel and the `/sbin/apparmor_parser` executable must be installed on the
host, otherwise containerd will [disable][cd-aa] AppArmor support.

### Other dependencies in previous versions of k0s

- up until k0s v1.21.9+k0s.0: `iptables`  
  Required for worker nodes. Resolved by @ncopa in [#1046] by adding `iptables`
  and friends to k0s's embedded binaries.

- up until k0s v1.21.7+k0s.0: `find`, `du` and `nice`  
  Required for worker nodes. Resolved upstream by @ncopa in
  [kubernetes/kubernetes#96115], contained in Kubernetes 1.21.8 ([5b13c8f68d4])
  and 1.22.0 ([d45ba645a8f]).

## Windows specific
<!--
The kubernetes/system-validators require certain Windows versions starting with
Windows Server 2016. k0s states that it requires Windows Server 2019, though.
-->

TBD.
