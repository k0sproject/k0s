# Commercial support

Mirantis can provide various different levels of support starting from DevCare (9-to-5) all the way to OpsCare+ with fully managed service.

On top of our normal [release and support](releases.md) model our commercial customers have access to critical security patches even for released versions that fall outside of the Open Source maintained releases.[^1] Commercial support also includes support for k0s related tooling such as [k0sctl](https://github.com/k0sproject/k0sctl).

If you are interested in commercial support for k0s check out our [support description](https://www.mirantis.com/support/enterprise-support-options/) and please [contact us](https://www.mirantis.com/contact/) for further details.
