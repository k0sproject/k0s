On top of our normal [release and support](releases.md) model our commercial customers have access to critical security patches even for released versions that fall outside of the Open Source maintained releases.[^1] Commercial support also includes support for k0s related tooling such as [k0sctl](https://github.com/k0sproject/k0sctl).
