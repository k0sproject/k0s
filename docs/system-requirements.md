# System requirements

Verify that your environment meets the system requirements for k0s.

## Hardware

The minimum hardware requirements for k0s detailed below are approximations and
thus results may vary.

| Role                | Virtual CPU (vCPU)     | Memory (RAM)             |
|---------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Controller node     | 1 vCPU (2 recommended) | 1 GB (2 recommended)     |
| Worker node         | 1 vCPU (2 recommended) | 0.5 GB (1 recommended)   |
| Controller + worker | 1 vCPU (2 recommended) | 1 GB (2 recommended)     |

**Note**: Use an SSD for [optimal storage performance](https://etcd.io/docs/current/op-guide/performance/) (cluster
latency and throughput are sensitive to storage).

The specific storage consumption for k0s is as follows:

| Role                 | Storage (k0s part) |
|----------------------|--------------------|
| Controller node      | ~0.5 GB            |
| Worker node          | ~1.3 GB            |
| Controller + worker  | ~1.7 GB            |

**Note**: The operating system and application requirements must be considered
in addition to the k0s part.

## Host operating system

- Linux (kernel v3.10 or later)
- Windows Server 2019

## Architecture

- x86-64
- ARM64
- ARMv7

## Networking

For information on the ports that k0s needs to function, refer to [networking](networking.md).

## OS dependencies

In most cases k0s does NOT have any OS level dependencies. The needed kernel configurations are documented [here](os-deps.md).
