# Create a Raspberry Pi 5 cluster

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have a [Raspberry Pi 5] and a
sufficiently large SD card of at least 32 GB. We will be using [Raspberry Pi OS]
for this guide, though k0s should run just fine on other 64-bit Linux
distributions for the Raspberry Pi 5 as well. Please [file a Bug] if you encounter
any issues.

[Raspberry Pi 5]: https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/
[Raspberry Pi OS]: https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/
[file a Bug]: https://github.com/k0sproject/k0s/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=BUG_REPORT.yml

## Set up the system

Follow the official Raspberry Pi instructions on [booting Pi OS from the USB drive](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/install-raspberry-pi-desktop/3) or another method depending on your needs.

### SSH Access

1. Typically, you can enable SSH while creating the bootable drive for Raspberry Pi OS. If not, you can enable it later

2. Add your public key to the server.
    From your host machine, run [ssh-copy-id] to copy your public SSH key to your Pi 5:

    ```bash
    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub <YOUR_USER_NAME>@<IP_ADDRESS_OF_THE_SERVER>
    ```

    When prompted, enter the password for your user account for the Pi. Your public key should be copied at the appropriate folder on the remote Pi automatically.

    Note: `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` is the default location for the public ssh key. If your key is elsewhere, adjust accordingly.

3. Verify SSH access

    ```shell
    ssh <YOUR_USER_NAME>@<IP_ADDRESS_OF_THE_SERVER>
    ```

    If your key has a paraphrase, you’ll be prompted for it.

### Enable the memory cgroup controller

Raspberry Pi OS does not enable the memory cgroup controller by default. However, it is required to run containerized workloads, so enable it:

1. Edit /boot/cmdline.txt:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt
    ```

    Append (on the same single line):

    ```bash
    cgroup_enable=memory cgroup_memory=1
    ```

2. Reboot

    ```bash
    sudo reboot
    ```

## Install k0s

### Download k0s

Download a [k0s release](https://github.com/k0sproject/k0s/releases/latest). For
example:

  ```shell
  wget -O /tmp/k0s https://github.com/k0sproject/k0s/releases/download/{{{ k0s_version }}}/k0s-{{{ k0s_version }}}-arm64 # replace version number!
  sudo install /tmp/k0s /usr/local/bin/k0s
  ```

― or ―

Use the k0s download script (as one command) to download the latest stable k0s
and make it executable in `/usr/bin/k0s`.

  ```shell
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get.k0s.sh | sudo sh
  ```

At this point you can run `k0s`:

  ```console
  $ sudo k0s version
  {{{ k0s_version }}}
  ```

To check if k0s's [system requirements](system-requirements.md) and [external
runtime dependencies](external-runtime-deps.md) are fulfilled by your current
setup, you can invoke `k0s sysinfo`:

  ```console
  ramesses-pi5@pi:~ $ sudo k0s sysinfo

### Deploy a Node using k0s

If you want a more hands-on process for setting up your Pi 5 devices as Kubernetes nodes with the k0s binary, refer to [the guide for Pi devices](./raspberry-pi4.md).

## Deploy a Node using k0sctl

### Install k0sctl on Your Host

Follow [the k0sctl installation guide](https://github.com/k0sproject/k0sctl#installation) and install k0sctl on your host machine.

### Single node K0s cluster

For this example, we'll create a cluster.yaml that describes your known Pi 5 device and use it as a single node (controller & worker) cluster, for example:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: k0sctl.k0sproject.io/v1beta1
  kind: Cluster
  metadata:
    name: k0s-cluster
    user: admin
  spec:
    hosts:
    - ssh:
        address: <IP_ADDRESS_OF_THE_SERVER>
        user: <YOUR_USER_NAME>
        port: 22
        keyPath: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
      role: controller+worker
  ```

### SSH agent

  By default, k0sctl doesn’t prompt you for passphrases, so the easiest solution is to load your key into an SSH agent before running k0sctl. Here’s how you can do it:

  1. Start the SSH agent (if not already running)

      ```bash
      eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
      ```

  2. ​​Add your private key (you’ll be prompted for the passphrase)

      ```bash
      ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
      ```

  3. Verify the key is loaded

      ```bash
      ssh-add -l
      ```

### Deploy cluster

  1. Apply the cluster.yaml using k0sctl on your local machine.

      ```console
      $ k0sctl apply --config cluster.yaml

  2. Fetch the kubeconfig use k0sctl.

      ```bash
        k0sctl kubeconfig --config cluster.yaml > pi_cluster.kubeconfig
      ```

  3. Export KUBECONFIG and verify

      ```console
      $ export KUBECONFIG=pi_cluster.kubeconfig
      $ kubectl get nodes
      NAME   STATUS   ROLES           AGE     VERSION
      pi     Ready    control-plane   2m54s   {{{ k8s_version }}}+k0s
      ```

## Tear down k0s on Pi 5

If you need to remove k0s entirely (for example, if you run into conflicts or just want a clean slate):

  1. Stop existing processes

      ```bash
      sudo k0s stop
      ```

  2. Reset k0s

      ```bash
      sudo k0s reset
      ```

  3. Remove k0s binaries

      ```bash
      sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/k0s
      ```

  4. Reboot Pi 5.

      ```bash
      sudo reboot
      ```
