## What happened to GitHub stargazers?

In September 2022 we made a human error while creating some build automation scripts&tools for the GitHub repository. Our automation accidentally changed the repo to a private one for few minutes. That itself is not a big deal and everything was restored quickly. But the nasty side effect is that it also removed all the stargazers at that point. :(

Before that mishap we had 4776 stargazers, making k0s one of the most popular Kubernetes distro out there.

**So if you are reading this, and have not yet starred the [k0s repository](https://github.com/k0sproject/k0s/) we would highly appreciate the :star: to get our numbers closer to what they used to be.**
