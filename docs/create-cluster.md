# Creating cluster with MKE

As MKE binary has everything it needs packaged into a single binary, it makes it super easy to spin up Kubernetes clusters.

## Pre-requisites

Download MKE binary from [releases](https://github.com/Mirantis/mke/releases/latest) and push it to all the nodes you wish to connect to the cluster.

That's it, really.

## Bootstrapping controller node

Create a [configuration](configuration.md) file if you wish to tune some of the settings.

```
$ mke server -c mke.yaml
```

That's it, really. MKE process will act as a "supervisor" for all the control plane components. In few seconds you'll have the control plane up-and-running.

Naturally, to make MKE boot up the control plane when the node itself reboots you should really make the mke process to be supervised by systemd or some other init system.

## Create join token

To be able to join workers into the cluster we need a token. The token embeds information with which we can enable mutual trust between the worker and controller(s) and allow the node to join the cluster as worker.

To get a token run the following on one of the existing controller nodes:
```sh
mke token create --role=worker
```

This will output a long [token](#tokens) which we will use to join the worker. To enhance security, we can also set an expiration time on the tokens by using:
```sh
mke token create --role=worker --expiry="100h"
```


## Joining worker(s) to cluster

To join the worker we need to run mke in worker mode with the token from previous step:
```sh
$ mke worker "long-join-token"
```

That's it, really.

Naturally, to make MKE boot up the worker components when the node itself reboots you should really make the mke process to be supervised by systemd or some other init system.

## Tokens

The tokens are actually base64 encoded [kubeconfigs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/). 

Why:
- well defined structure
- can be used directly as bootstrap auth configs for kubelet
- embeds CA info for mutual trust

The actual bearer token embedded in the kubeconfig is a [bootstrap token](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/bootstrap-tokens/). For controller join token and for worker join token we use different usage attributes so we can make sure we can validate the token role on the controller side.


## Join controller node

To be able to join a new controller node into the cluster you must be using either etcd or some externalized data store (MySQL or Postgres) via kine. Also make sure the [configurations](configuration.md) match for the data storage on all controller nodes.

To create a join token for the new controller, run the following on existing controller node:
```sh
mke token create --role=controller --expiry=1h
```

The on the new controller, run:
```sh
mke server "long-join-token"
```
