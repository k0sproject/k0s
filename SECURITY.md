## Reporting a Vulnerability

k0s supports responsible disclosure and endeavors to resolve security issues in a reasonable timeframe.

To report a security vulnerability, you can use GitHub's [private security reporting] feature under the [Security tab].
That allows the reporter and maintainers to coordinate the disclosure and the fix before public disclosure.
