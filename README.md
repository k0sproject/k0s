<!-- Start Overview -->
## Overview

k0s is an open source, all-inclusive Kubernetes distribution, which is configured with all of the features needed to build a Kubernetes cluster and packaged as a single binary for ease of use. Due to its simple design, flexible deployment options and modest system requirements, k0s is well suited for

- Any cloud
- Bare metal
- Edge and IoT

k0s drastically reduces the complexity of installing and running a CNCF certified Kubernetes distribution. With k0s new clusters can be bootstrapped in minutes and developer friction is reduced to zero. This allows anyone with no special skills or expertise in Kubernetes to easily get started.

k0s is distributed as a single binary with zero host OS dependencies besides the host OS kernel. It works with any Linux without additional software packages or configuration. Any security vulnerabilities or performance issues can be fixed directly in the k0s distribution that makes it extremely straightforward to keep the clusters up-to-date and secure.

<!-- Start Motivation -->
## Motivation

_We have seen a gap between the host OS and Kubernetes that runs on top of it: How to ensure they work together as they are upgraded independent from each other? Who is responsible for vulnerabilities or performance issues originating from the host OS that affect the K8S on top?_

**&rarr;** k0s is fully self contained. Itâ€™s distributed as a single binary with no host OS deps besides the kernel. Any vulnerability or perf issues may be fixed in k0s Kubernetes.

_We have seen K8S with partial FIPS security compliance: How to ensure security compliance for critical applications if only part of the system is FIPS compliant?_

**&rarr;** k0s core + all included host OS dependencies + components on top may be compiled and packaged as a 100% FIPS compliant distribution using a proper toolchain.

_We have seen Kubernetes with cumbersome lifecycle management, high minimum system requirements, weird host OS and infra restrictions, and/or need to use different distros to meet different use cases._

**&rarr;** k0s is designed to be lightweight at its core. It comes with a tool to automate cluster lifecycle management. It works on any host OS and infrastructure, and may be extended to work with any use cases such as edge, IoT, telco, public clouds, private data centers, and hybrid & hyper converged cloud applications without sacrificing the pure Kubernetes compliance or amazing developer experience.
<!-- End Motivation -->

## Status

k0s is ready for production (starting from v1.21.0+k0s.0). Since the initial release of k0s back in November 2020, we have made numerous releases, improved stability, added new features, and most importantly, listened to our users and community in an effort to create the most modern Kubernetes product out there. The active development continues to make k0s even better.

<!-- Start Scope -->
## Scope

While some Kubernetes distros package everything and the kitchen sink, k0s tries to minimize the amount of "add-ons" to bundle in. Instead, we aim to provide a robust and versatile "base" for running Kubernetes in various setups. Of course we will provide some ways to easily control and setup various "add-ons", but we will not bundle many of those into k0s itself. There are a couple of reasons why we think this is the correct way:

- Many of the addons such as ingresses, service meshes, storage etc. are VERY opinionated. We try to build this base with fewer opinions. :D
- Keeping up with the upstream releases with many external addons is very maintenance heavy. Shipping with old versions does not make much sense either.

With strong enough arguments we might take in new addons, but in general those should be something that are essential for the "core" of k0s.
<!-- End Scope -->

## Build

The requirements for building k0s from source are as follows:

- GNU Make (v3.81 or newer)
- coreutils
- findutils
- Docker

All of the compilation steps are performed inside Docker containers, no
installation of Go is required.

The k0s binary can be built in different ways:

The "k0s" way, self-contained, all binaries compiled from source, statically
linked, including embedded binaries:

```shell
make
```

The "package maintainer" way, without building and embedding the required
binaries. This assumes necessary binaries are provided separately at runtime:

```shell
make EMBEDDED_BINS_BUILDMODE=none
```

Docker build integration is enabled by default. However, in environments without
Docker, you can use the Go toolchain installed on the host system to build k0s
without embedding binaries. Note that static linking is not possible with
glibc-based toolchains:

```shell
make DOCKER='' EMBEDDED_BINS_BUILDMODE=none BUILD_GO_LDFLAGS_EXTRA=''
```

Note that the k0s build system does not currently support building the embedded
binaries without Docker. However, the embedded binaries can be built
independently using Docker:

```shell
make -C embedded-bins
```

Builds can be done in parallel:

```shell
make -j$(nproc)
```

## Smoke test

Additionally to the requirements for building k0s, the smoke tests _do_ require
a local Go installation. you can run `./vars.sh go_version` in a terminal to
find out the version that's being used to build k0s. It will print the
corresponding Go version to stdout.

To run a basic smoke test after build:

```shell
make check-basic
```

### Debugging smoke tests

Every smoke test can be executed independently, the complete list of smoke tests is
available in `inttest/Makefile.variables``

It's possible to attach a debugger to a smoke test but it requires some modifications:

1. k0s must be compiled with symbols: `DEBUG=true make k0s`
2. The source code must be present in `go/src/github.com/k0sproject/` and
the go cache in `/run/k0s-build/go`

   ```shell
   sudo mkdir -p /go/src/github.com/k0sproject/ /run/k0s-build/
   sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) /go/src/github.com/k0sproject/ /run/k0s-build/
   ln -s <K0s source dir>/go/src/github.com/k0sproject/k0s
   ln -s <K0s source dir>/build/cache/go /run/k0s-build/go
   ```

3. Modify the inttest to include to run the command that you want to run:

   ```go
   // SetK0sCommand is only evaluated when Controllers or Workers are initialized
   // feel free to call it where it's appropriate and change the position.
   // This example enables the debugger for the controllers but not the workers
   s.SetK0sCommand("PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH /go/bin/dlv exec --headless --listen :4040 -- /usr/local/bin/k0s")
   s.Require().NoError(s.InitController(0, controllerArgs...))
   s.SetK0sCommand("/usr/local/bin/k0s")
   s.Require().NoError(s.RunWorkers())
   ```

4. Launch the tests with `K0S_DEBUG_TEST=true` so that it uses the correct image:
`K0S_KEEP_AFTER_TESTS=always DEBUG=true K0S_DEBUG_TESTS=true make check-<test name>`

5. Connect to the remote debugger using the correct container IP
`dlv -connect <container ip address>:4040`
