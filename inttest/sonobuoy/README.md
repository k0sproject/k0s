# Conformance Testing

The terraform code included in this directory will help you quickly set-up a k0s kubernetes cluster on AWS to run the kubernetes conformance tests against.

## Requirements

1. [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli#install-terraform)
2. [K0sctl](https://github.com/k0sproject/k0sctl/#installation) (a k0s configuration tool)

This guide assumes you have the appropriate AWS environment variables exported for authentication (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`).

## Running Terraform

Terraform requires the AWS CLI authentication operations. For more details, refer to the [AWS provider documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#environment-variables).

Once the correct variables are exported, the commands below are needed to run terraform:

```shell
export TF_VAR_cluster_name="k0s_conformance" # can be changed to any value
export TF_VAR_k0s_version=latest # refers to release tags from https://github.com/k0sproject/k0s/releases

cd terraform

terraform init
terraform plan # to view the planned changes
terraform apply
```

### Run k0sctl

The terraform command will create a `k0sctl.yaml` file.

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: "k0sctl.k0sproject.io/v1beta1"
kind: "cluster"
metadata:
  name: "k0s_conformance-b0b14b7c"
spec:
  hosts:
  - k0sBinaryPath: null
    role: "controller"
    ssh:
      address: "63.32.21.232"
      keyPath: "./aws_private.pem"
      user: "ubuntu"
    uploadBinary: true
  - k0sBinaryPath: null
    role: "worker"
    ssh:
      address: "54.216.71.108"
      keyPath: "./aws_private.pem"
      user: "ubuntu"
    uploadBinary: true
  - k0sBinaryPath: null
    role: "worker"
    ssh:
      address: "3.250.52.147"
      keyPath: "./aws_private.pem"
      user: "ubuntu"
    uploadBinary: true
  k0s:
    version: "1.29.4+k0s.0"
```

To deploy a k0s cluster on the AWS machine, run:

```shell
k0sctl apply -c k0sctl.yaml
```

Example output:

```shell
➜ k0sctl apply -c k0sctl.yaml
