Squashing Commits # Commits on your branch should represent meaningful milestones or units of work. Small commits that contain typo fixes, rebases, review feedbacks, etc should be squashed. To do that, it's best to perform an interactive rebase : Example # If you PR has 3 commits, count backwards from your last commit using HEAD~3 : git rebase -i HEAD~3 Output would be similar to this: pick f7f3f6d Changed some code pick 310154e fixed some typos pick a5f4a0d made some review changes # Rebase 710f0f8..a5f4a0d onto 710f0f8 # # Commands: # p, pick <commit> = use commit # r, reword <commit> = use commit, but edit the commit message # e, edit <commit> = use commit, but stop for amending # s, squash <commit> = use commit, but meld into previous commit # f, fixup <commit> = like \"squash\", but discard this commit's log message # x, exec <command> = run command (the rest of the line) using shell # b, break = stop here (continue rebase later with 'git rebase --continue') # d, drop <commit> = remove commit # l, label <label> = label current HEAD with a name # t, reset <label> = reset HEAD to a label # m, merge [-C <commit> | -c <commit>] <label> [# <oneline>] # . create a merge commit using the original merge commit's # . message (or the oneline, if no original merge commit was # . specified).
